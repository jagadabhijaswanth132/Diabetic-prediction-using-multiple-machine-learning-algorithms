TOPIC - Diabetic prediction using multiple machine learning algorithms

Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset?resource=download 

    This exploration plans to carry out exact prescient methodologies for diabetic prediction utilizing a specific dataset obtained from Kaggle. The above dataset 
consisting of 100,000 records with clinical and demographic information, for example, age, gender, hypertension, smoking history, BMI,  HbA1c level, heart disease, and also blood glucose level, will be examined.

    These methods will recognize essential predictors of the diabetes alongside classifying patients as diabetic or the non-diabetic. The dataset's wide extension and 
far reaching patient profiles upgrade the approaches' predictive accuracy. The following Ethical contemplations are addressed as the dataset is anonymized and sticks to GDPR prerequisites.
